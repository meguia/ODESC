# ODESC
A Library of axamples of ODEs in Supercollider

Several examples of ODEs based on the extension Fb1 for single sample feedback from [miSCellaneous_lib](https://github.com/dkmayer/miSCellaneous_lib).

The main purpose is to use the library as a test bed or sandbox to explore different dynamical systems modulated in the neighboorhood of bifurcations of codimension two or higher as an audification of the unfolding of that singularity rather than as a compositional tool for the moment.
